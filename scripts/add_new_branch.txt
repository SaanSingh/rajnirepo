===== ADD NEW BRANCH 

Step1: Before creating a new branch, pull the changes from upstream. Your master needs to be up to date.
	$ git pull
Step2: Create the branch on your local machine and switch in this branch :
	git checkout -b [name_of_your_new_branch]
	cd [name_of_your_new_branch]
Step3: Push the branch on github :
	$ git push origin [name_of_your_new_branch]

** After performing above steps, your branch will be available in github with all files in new branch.


=== Push new changes to upstream 
 - assume you have added new file to branch on local
$ cd to branch
$ git add [filename] /[*]
$ git commit -am ["MSG"]
$ git push 
 
======= Push changes from upstream
- assuimg you have deleted some file from upstream and want to pull changes to local
  	$ cd to branch 
$ git pull 

===== MISCELENIOUS 
-- You can see all the branches created by using :
	$ git branch -a
-- Push changes from your commit into your branch :
	$ git push [name_of_your_new_remote] [url]
-- Update your branch when the original branch from official repository has been updated :
	$ git fetch [name_of_your_remote]
